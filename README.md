## E-Tree
This project is for EarthxHack hackathon. The objective of this hackathon is to create ANYTHING that has a positive impact to the environment || the world.

We created a Fullstack E-Commerce Web Application utilizing data that the team populated in Google Firebase. We believe that just another breakthrough technology would not be sufficient to make an impact in our environment. At this moment, we need collaborations from as many people as possible, and the very first thing that we have to do, is to let people know of all the products out there. Currently, the majority of people do not know that a lot of products that they're using has an alternative which is better to the environment. We created this web application in the hope of people knowing more about all the eco-products and starting to replace them with non-compostable or non-biodegrabale products.

Technologies Used:
* HTML/CSS, Javascript
* ReactJS (Front-end)
* Google Firebase (Back-end)

Functionalities:
* Access to featured products for each categories using side drawer.
* Add to wishlist function - user can go back anytime
